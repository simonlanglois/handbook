# Referral Bonuses

Referrals from people who already work at Stamped are one of the best signals we can get about whether or not a candidate will be successful at Stamped. Stamped employees understand Stamped’s needs and what it’s like to work at Stamped, and their relationship with the candidate means they know a lot more than we can learn during an interview process.

In order to get good referrals, everyone needs to know which positions are open, know how to start the recruiting process, have time to search their network, and feel aligned with the company incentives. Open positions should be posted on [stamped.ai/careers](https://stamped.ai/careers) and also in the #hiring channel so that everyone sees who we’re trying to hire. We’ll host a company lunch with food on the second Tuesday of every month where we talk about which positions are open and go through everyone’s online networks looking for and thinking about candidates. Employees will do initial outreach to interesting connection, which will give us a good space to talk about how we start the recruiting process.

**We offer a $[TODO] referral bonus for any new hire that comes from an employee referral to help align company incentives with individual incentives.** All employees (except the founders) are eligible for the referral bonus. The referral date can’t be earlier than the date the job is posted and the hiring of the referred employee has to happen within 180 days (six months) of the initial referral. The referral must represent the candidate’s first contact with Stamped, and only the first employee to refer a candidate can get the bonus. The referrer should send the candidate’s information to the person in charge of HR, should make an introduction to the candidate, and should expect to be engaged during the recruiting and interview process. The referring employee must still be employed by Stamped during the hired candidate’s first 30 days of employment, and will be paid within 90 days of the referred employee’s first day. Any disputes or interpretations of this program should be sent to Simon.
